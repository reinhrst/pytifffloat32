I do not in any way plan to get rich of this software, so don't worry about any huge fees; all I want is the occasional appreciative pint of beer; I'm pretty sure that in almost all cases we can settle this for a couple of pounds, or in some cases I will even settle for a nice story on how you plan to use it :).

Actually... Contact me anyways if you're using this software.... I'd like to know that it's being used.
